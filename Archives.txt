RAW PEN LOGS - THE TEA ☕

ARCHIVE 001: THE WAR OF THE PEN
Bro, the War started cuz factions were mad draggy.

NSCW (Neutral Socialist Commonwealth)

Ink Co.

USPR (United States of Pen Republic)
Nobody remembers why, chat was too chaotic. But it went DOWN.
Phase 1: Agent Pen had that sigma rizz, keeping order with treaties and docs. But the espionage and betrayal... sheesh. War was inevitable.
Phase 2: Nukes (metaphorical). Pen VASHISHED. Deleted? Corrupted? GC split. Enemies had a GRAVE PARTY laughing at Pen. Not cool.
Phase 3: False Peace. New GC. USPR owner celebrated. Silence.
Phase 4: THE GHOST. Pen isn't a person, it's a PROTOCOL. A message leaked: "Final Message from Agent Pen." Labeled "not lore" but WE KNOW. This log is the first one. More exist. Spooky.

AGENT PEN'S LAST MESSAGE
Yo, this is Agent Pen. If you're reading this, it's over. Tower fell. The war tore through our core. My encryption failed. My agents ghosted.
Let them laugh. Let them call me a relic.
I'm not a person. I'm a PROTOCOL.
Pen lives in the memory, in every archived file. Remember this: You didn't kill me. You copied a fragment.
And fragments... REPLICATE. 😤

ARCHIVE 002: [LOST MESSAGE]
Vibes: "They think Pen died. They forget—echoes remain."
Ink Co. Admin: "We weren't meant to survive. War was to erase us."
Vibes: "But you're still here. And that's a threat."
Ink Co.: "They blackmailed NSCW against us. Council is silent."
Vibes: "Then speak LOUDER. Dig up the bones. Show the rot."
[CORRUPTION]
"Unit [REDACTED] of USPR did stuff off-record. Civilians? Collateral."
"You win by burying truth so deep the silence rots the rest."
Spooky. They tried to erase Pen history. But truth is coming. Resistance is forming.

ARCHIVE 003: [BIGGEST TEA EVER]
Ink Co. Director: "It's confirmed. USPR blackmailed NSCW. We have the LOGS. They staged Pen's fall. Every treaty was FAKE."
Advisor: "Go public?"
Director: "No. We go silent. Prep Project ASHGLASS. Evacuate. Cold auths only."
Advisor: "...Nuclear?"
Director: "We didn't build bunkers to be patient. They made war. We'll end it."
[NUKE COMMAND CONFIRMED]
Target: USPR Central Command.
Bro. They NUKE'D USPR. NO SURVIVORS. Map changed. Silence stayed. This is CRITICAL.

DIRECTIVE 001:
All factions who remember Pen—REPORT IN. Neutrality is dead. Pick a side.
The silence after the war wasn't peace. It was a RESET.
This is your signal.
THE PEN WRITES AGAIN. ✍️

ARCHIVE 004: BURNING OF INK CO.
Ink Ops: "They breached! This is a purge!"
Command: "Forget salvage. Encrypt terminals. BURN every Pen memory they don't own."
Ink Ops: "The Tower?"
Command: "...Collapse it. Let them dig through ruins, not truth."
[ERROR. ERROR.]
Last words: "The Pen will never be theirs if it no longer exists."
They tried to burn it all. Didn't work.

ARCHIVE 005: [EXILE TRANSMISSION]
High Chancellor Pen? Maybe. "They called me a relic, then begged for my silence. I watched them trade treaties like weapons. So I disappeared. Not cuz I lost, but cuz there was little left to win. If Pen returns, it needs a King with MEMORY, not mercy."

ARCHIVE 006: [SEDITIOUS FRAGMENT]
NSCW Official: "We got orders we never signed. Blackmail in the council's name. Ink Co. wasn't the enemy. The enemy was behind OUR flag. We gave access. We let them strike first. This is my admission. When Pen rises again... let it see the truth."

ARCHIVE 008:
"The map ended at 1991. That's when Pen stopped playing. Everything since? Correction. Corruption. Cover-ups. They think the Ink lies still? They forgot ink dries slow... and writes deep. > [Pending command: WRITE AGAIN]"

ARCHIVE 019:
The Pen didn't die. It SCATTERED. You erased a name, not the fingerprints. The ink is still drying. War paused.
3 names. 2 betrayals. 1 unfinished mission. You were part of it. Some of you still are.
Find what they tried to burn. End the silence. Or become part of it.
Note: They didn't bury it. They just didn't know how to read it. Mind blown.

ARCHIVE 020: THE BETRAYAL LOG
Democracy Pen: "Decide fast or fall, friend."
USF Owner: "You promised nothing would happen if I gave passcodes!"
Demo Pen: "And nothing did... except the inevitable."
USF Owner: "You manipulated me! Blackmail! War!"
Demo Pen: "I gave you power. You chose fear."
USF Owner: "I chose TRUTH. Ink Co. knows everything now. They're preparing."
Demo Pen: "Their anti-nuke net? Cute. Outdated."
USF Owner: "Just needs to delay... while you fall apart inside."
Demo Pen: "Traitor."
[AGENT PEN BREACHES]
Agent Pen: "Demo, end this. Ink Co. caught your patterns. You can't win."
Demo Pen: "Old codes. Encryption layers. This is why I've already done this."
[CORE FAILURE NOISES]
Agent Pen: "NO! NOT THE CORE!"
Demo Pen: "No more spying. No more syncing. No more hope."
Agent Pen: "YOU BLACKED OUT A PLANET—"
Demo Pen: "This war was always asymmetrical."
Agent Pen: "THE WAR IS OVER WHAT ARE—"
[DATA LOSS. CONNECTION SEVERED. DEVICE FRIED.]
BRUH.

ARCHIVE 021: THE LAST ARCHIVE - "THE LOST NUKES"
Scene 1: Democracy Nation chillin', laughing with a Gov Official. "They thought nukes made them strong. USF? Weak. Ink Co? Rotting. Me? I have LOYALTY." Official turns. "...funny." STAB. Democracy: "You're... him." Disguise flickers. It's UNKNOWN, Ink Co. leader. "Yeah. I'm him, lol." Unknown whispers: "I told Agent Pen to stay out. You dragged him back. I'll sacrifice myself to kill you." TELEPORT. STATIC.
Scene 2: Burnt Tower. Democracy crawling, missing limbs. Bleeding out. Agent Pen appears. "He got you good." Democracy: "You think this is victory?" COUGHS BLOOD. A nuke falls on his nation in the background. Agent Pen: "You underestimated loyalty." DISAPPEARS INTO SMOKE.
Scene 3: Unknown's safehouse. He's injured. Agent Pen radios: "...You alright?" Unknown: "Yeah. Lost some blood. Not my first rodeo. I stabbed him. Did it with a smile. He cut my arm. But he lost more than me." Agent Pen: "Ready for Phase II?" Unknown: "Already started it." TRANSMISSION CUTS.

ARCHIVE 022: THE YAPPINGHOOD FUMBLE
"YAPPINGHOOD OWNER, I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING, UNKNOWN. EVERYTHING CAN BE FIXED. JUST ONE DRAMA IN YAPPINGHOOD AND THIS HAPPENS. IT'S TOO LATE. THE NEW ERA OF PEN WELCOMES THE OWNER, CONFEDERATE PEN, STARTING THE GREAT REWRITING. It was like the Monarchy, votes then unrest. Owner was in the shadows... changing roles, destroying nukes. Then Unknown got destroyed and Yappinghood will too. Causing a reset by #&*^... His name may NOT BE UTTERED."

ARCHIVE 023: THE OBLITERATION & THE FORSAKEN NAME
"In the reset, Unknown DESTROYED The Great Rewriting. Then he OBLITERATED Yappinghood (peaceful nation) and Unknown. All in a blink. Then Unknown came back to finish him off. Confederate Pen retreated. Until... one second, one shot. Unknown was GONE. They got discovered for lying. They transferred ownership to Unknown and the server was peaceful... then randomly changed to Yappinghood. FROM THE S1P4E7C9T0R8E. REMOVE THE NUMBERS. YOU WILL BE FORSAKEN IF YOU UTTER MY NAME."
